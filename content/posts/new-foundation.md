# Welcome.

Last year, God blessed me with a new home. It was a huge milestone, but really, it was just the starting line.

As an engineer, I have a hard time leaving things well enough alone. I look at a blank wall and see a place for custom shelving. I look at a light switch and wonder how to make it smarter. A house isn't just a place to sleep; it's a project that never really ends.

**Less Consuming, More Creating**

I also realized recently that I spend a lot of time *consuming* information—watching tutorials, reading documentation, and scrolling through other people's builds. It is easy to get stuck in "research mode" forever.

I started this blog to hold myself accountable to a simple goal: **Produce more than I consume.** I want to spend my time actually building these ideas and documenting the process, rather than just planning them.

## What I'm Working On
This site is going to be a collection of the projects that keep me busy on the weekends. You can expect to see:

* **Making it Mine:** Woodworking projects and renovations to make this space truly feel like home.
* **The Smart Home:** My attempts to use technology to make life a little easier (without making it more complicated).
* **The Garage:** Keeping the cars running and building a workspace that I can be proud of.

I'm not an expert in all of these things, but I enjoy the process of figuring them out. I hope that by sharing what I've built—and what I'm currently working on—I can spark some ideas for your own projects.

Thanks for stopping by.
